Kinect Azure Open Questions 

Why BGRA Color configuration 

MKV file does not accept BGRA for color type. But BGRA is what is needed to make color 3D in viewer. 
Can you record registered color and depth?

Kinect color camera doesn't natively produce bgra and doesn't use the alpha channel in this format. So why is it needed in the viewer?

The color camera does not natively produce BGRA32 images. Setting K4A_IMAGE_FORMAT_COLOR_BGRA32 for color_format will result in higher CPU utilization.
